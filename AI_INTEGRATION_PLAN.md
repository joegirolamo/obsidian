# AI Integration Plan for Obsidian Platform

## Overview
The Obsidian platform aims to create a comprehensive "brain" for each client by collecting metrics, intake answers, tool connections, and performance data. This information will be used to generate AI-powered insights, scorecards, and opportunities.

## Data Structure Optimizations

### 1. Structured Scorecard Data
We've already started by adding fields to the Opportunity model:
- `score`: Numeric score for each scorecard category
- `maxScore`: Maximum possible score (defaults to 100)
- `serviceAreas`: Array of service areas relevant to this category
- `highlights`: Structured JSON data for issues identified

**To Do:**
- [ ] Ensure all components properly read and write these fields
- [ ] Add validation to ensure data integrity
- [ ] Consider adding timestamp for when scores were last updated

### 2. "Brain" JSON Field
Add a denormalized field to the Business model to store a pre-processed representation of all client data.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Add `aiData` JSON field to Business model
- [ ] Create scheduled job to update this field daily
- [ ] Add versioning to track how data evolves over time

### 3. Metric Signals for Scorecards
We need a way to store measurable signals that contribute to scorecard scores.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Create `ScorecardMetric` model or add `metricSignals` field to Opportunity
- [ ] Link metrics to specific scorecard categories
- [ ] Create UI for managing metric signals

### 4. Opportunity Connections
Connect opportunities to highlights to show how they address specific issues.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Add `highlightId` reference to opportunities
- [ ] Create UI to show the relationship between highlights and opportunities
- [ ] Track implementation status

## Feature Enhancements

### 1. Brain Viewer
We've implemented a Brain Viewer component that shows the current state of the client's data as it would be sent to AI.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Add filters to focus on specific data types
- [ ] Add copy button for easy sharing
- [ ] Add visualization options for different data types

### 2. AI Prompt Templates
Create a system for managing AI prompt templates that can be used with the brain data.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Create `PromptTemplate` model
- [ ] Build UI for creating and editing templates
- [ ] Implement template testing functionality

### 3. AI-Generated Content Library
Store and organize content generated by AI for each client.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Create `AIContent` model
- [ ] Implement versioning system
- [ ] Add feedback mechanism to improve future generations

### 4. AI Integration Service
Implement a service that handles communication with AI models.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Create API endpoints for sending prompts
- [ ] Implement caching for similar requests
- [ ] Add rate limiting and usage tracking

## UI/UX Improvements

### 1. Data Collection Flows
Optimize the UI for collecting the most valuable data for AI insights.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Create guided setup wizard
- [ ] Add progress indicators for data completeness
- [ ] Prioritize high-value data collection

### 2. Dashboard Enhancements
Update dashboards to showcase AI-generated insights.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Add AI insights section to dashboard
- [ ] Create visual indicators for data quality
- [ ] Add data freshness indicators

### 3. Opportunity Management
Improve how users interact with AI-generated opportunities.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Add batch actions for implementing opportunities
- [ ] Create progress tracking for opportunity implementation
- [ ] Allow for feedback on opportunity quality

## Infrastructure Changes

### 1. Database Optimization
Ensure the database structure supports efficient AI operations.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Add indexes for commonly queried fields
- [ ] Implement caching for brain data
- [ ] Consider read replicas for heavy analysis

### 2. API Architecture
Design APIs that support efficient AI integration.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Create versioned endpoints for AI data
- [ ] Implement partial updates for brain data
- [ ] Add webhooks for data change notifications

### 3. Security Enhancements
Ensure AI operations maintain data security.

**To Do:**
- [ ] Implement fine-grained access controls
- [ ] Add audit logging for AI operations
- [ ] Create data anonymization options for sensitive clients

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- ✅ Structure the database to support AI operations
- ✅ Implement basic data collection
- ✅ Create Brain Viewer for transparency

### Phase 2: Integration
- [ ] Implement AI service connection
- [ ] Create prompt template system
- [ ] Build basic insight generation

### Phase 3: Optimization
- [ ] Refine data collection based on AI feedback
- [ ] Enhance visualization of AI-generated insights
- [ ] Implement automated opportunity generation

### Phase 4: Automation
- [ ] Create automated workflows based on AI insights
- [ ] Implement predictive analytics
- [ ] Develop recommendation engine

## Success Metrics
- Data completeness percentage per client
- Time to generate insights
- Opportunity implementation rate
- Client engagement with AI-generated content
- Reduction in manual analysis time
