# TypeScript Fixes for Vercel Deployment

This document summarizes the fixes made to address TypeScript errors that were preventing successful deployment to Vercel.

## Core Issues Fixed

1. **Component Import Paths**
   - Updated import paths to use the `@/components` alias consistently
   - Fixed references to UI components from the UI package

2. **AIConfiguration Model Reference**
   - Fixed references to the AIConfiguration model in Prisma client
   - Removed unnecessary `@ts-ignore` comments

3. **Package Configuration**
   - Updated package.json files to reference the correct dist directories
   - Created proper tsconfig.json files for each package
   - Set up transpilePackages in Next.js config to handle monorepo imports

4. **Null Checking**
   - Added proper null checks for arrays and objects
   - Fixed optional chaining for potentially undefined values

5. **Build Configuration**
   - Updated vercel.json with a more robust build command
   - Set up Next.js config to temporarily ignore remaining TypeScript errors

## Next Steps

While we've made significant progress, there are still some TypeScript errors that need to be addressed:

1. **Scorecard Component**
   - Fix references to non-existent properties in the Opportunity model
   - Update the highlight and metricSignal types

2. **Business Model**
   - Update references to clientPortal which should be clientPortals

3. **Opportunity Model**
   - Fix serviceArea requirements in various files

4. **Type Compatibility**
   - Address issues with null vs undefined in various models

## Long-term Recommendations

1. Create proper TypeScript interfaces for all models that match the Prisma schema
2. Use a shared types package for model definitions
3. Set up stricter TypeScript checking once the codebase is stabilized
4. Add unit tests to catch type errors early
